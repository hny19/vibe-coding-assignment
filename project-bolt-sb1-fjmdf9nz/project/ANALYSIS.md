Comparison of Coding Tools
           The world of software development is changing so fast these days that it's sometimes hard to keep up.
Back in the day, when we sat down at the computer, it was just us, our coffee, and that screen in front of us.
Now, things are very different. Suddenly, we have smart assistants by our side that understand our code better than we do.
The new generation tools I've been exploring for this assignment, known as “Vibe Coding,” represent the pinnacle of our coding
journey, in my mind. Let's take a look together at what sets these new tools apart from the old ones and how they're changing the lives of
students like us.
                 
	       Back in the day, before this AI hype started, those classic code completers we used were actually our best friends. But what
they could do was so limited that it was sometimes annoying. They only knew what code to put next to what, or reminded us of the name of the
variable we defined. They didn't understand the real purpose of the code we wrote; they just blindly checked whether it followed the rules.
Their biggest skill was correcting minor spelling mistakes or a forgotten semicolon. They could never help us when we tried to build complex
logic or when we couldn't figure something out. They were completely uninformed about the rest of the project, just staring at the line we were
writing at that moment like robots.
            			
			
            Although I discovered GitHub Copilot a little later, things changed when I started using it. I thought it was really impressive that
it could predict the next line before we even touched the keyboard and display it faintly in front of us. But as I used it more, I realized 
that Copilot was actually just acting like a super fast, memorized completion tool most of the time. It mostly just looked at where the cursor
was and the file that was open at that moment. It couldn't complete the picture in its head because it couldn't see what was going on in the 
project as a whole. It was fine when writing a function, but it couldn't really tell how that function would work with a file in another part
of the project. Sometimes he would even make up code that wasn't there, and I would be left scratching my head at this situation.

            
            Writing code with ChatGPT in the browser is a tedious process, in my opinion. They're very smart, yes, but that copy-paste cycle
really wears you out. Get the code, paste it, wait for the response, go back... Your attention gets lost in all that going back and forth.
Plus, since it couldn't see the project, I had to explain everything in great detail to it. It didn't know where each file was or what I was
trying to do unless I told it step by step.
    
             Vibe Coding Tools (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) This is where tools like Cursor or Windsurf really make a difference. They don't just
complete the code; they practically live inside the project with us. They scan all the files and know everything by heart. When there's an
error, they don't just look at that line; they look at the entire project and fix it right away. It feels like an experienced friend is coding
right beside me. They're as smart as ChatGPT but also know every corner of the editor. This will change us; it seems like we'll no longer be
code laborers but coders who manage the code.



            In summary: old methods handle letters, Copilot handles lines, and these new tools handle the entire project. They speed up our work quite a
 bit, leaving us to just sit back and figure out the reasoning.
