## 1. Tool Selection Justification
I chose the Bolt.new tool for this assignment. Since I am currently using a library computer,
I couldn't install anything (VS Code, Node.js, etc.). Bolt runs entirely in the browser and instantly displays a live preview of
my code in the side panel, which made my work much easier.

2. Development Process
The development process was incredibly fast.
Start: I started with the command, “Build a modern Todo List using React and Tailwind CSS that stores data in memory.”
Iteration: The first version worked, but the design was simple. I gave a second command: “Make the design more modern and add dark mode.”
* The project was completely finished in just 2-3 chat steps.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions
The only technical issue I encountered was that the list didn't update instantly when I pressed the delete button.
Solution: Instead of trying to fix the code manually, I said, in line with Vibe Coding logic, “The list isn't updating after deletion, 
check the state structure.” The AI understood the error and fixed the code in seconds.

## 4. Reflection
The Vibe Coding experience made me question my coding habits.
Speed: It was great that “tedious” tasks like creating files and installing libraries were completely eliminated.
Role: I felt like an architect “directing” the AI rather than “writing” the code.
Outcome: I will definitely use these tools in the future, especially when I want to quickly launch a project (MVP).
